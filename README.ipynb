    "# About the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify elements of fraudulent job postings so that I can predict whether or not a job posting is real.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "Inaccurate predictions of home values have the potential to ruin us. The efficacy of our model could determine whether or not we can stay in the instant home-buying business. With this project, I will determine which attributes of single-family residential properties contribute most to their tax assessed value. Using our data from 2017, my goal is to develop a model that will predict these property values with more accuracy than our current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    " 1. Are job listings without a degree requirement more likely to be fake?\n",
    " 2. Is there a region that is more likely to have fake job listings?\n",
    " 3. Is there a difference in frequency of fake job listings across employment types? \n",
    " 4. Are there any words or phrases that occur commonly in fake job listings?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "| Variable | Meaning |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- |\n",
    "| jobs     | Full, original dataframe of job listing information |\n",
    "| train    | Sample (56%) of `jobs` used for exploring data and fitting/training models|\n",
    "| validate | Sample (24%) of `jobs` used to evaluate multiple models |\n",
    "| test     | Sample (20%) of `jobs` used to evaluate the best model |\n",
    "| x_train  | `train`, but only with scaled columns |\n",
    "| y_train  | `train`, but only the target |\n",
    "| x_validate | `validate`, but only with scaled columns |\n",
    "| y_validate | `validate`, but only the target |\n",
    "| x_test   | `test`, but only with scaled columns |\n",

    "## The Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function to acquire the necessary job listing data from a csv file.\n",
    "2. Define a function to clean the acquired data.\n",
    "3. Define a function to split the cleaned data.\n",
    "4. Define a function to scale the split data.\n",
    "5. Define a function to combine the previous steps into a single function.\n",
    "6. Ensure all functions work properly and add them to wrangle.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore\n",
    "1. Ask a clear question.\n",
    "2. Develop null and alternative hypotheses for that question.\n",
    "3. Use visualizations and statistical tests to find answers.\n",
    "4. Clearly state the answer to the question and summarize findings.\n",
    "5. Repeat for a total of at least 4 questions.\n",
    "6. Summarize key findings, takeaways, and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "1. Select a metric to use for evaluating models and explain why that metric was chosen.\n",
    "2. Create and evaluate a baseline model.\n",
    "    - Find mean value of target\n",
    "    - Set all predictions to that value\n",
    "    - Evaluate based on selected evaluation metric\n",
    "3. Develop three models.\n",
    "4. Evaluate all three models on the train sample, note observations.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the top two models on the validate sample, note observations.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the top performing model on the test sample, note observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliver\n",
    "1. Ensure final report notebook is thoroughly code commented.\n",
    "2. Ensure notebook contains enough Markdown cells to guide the reader through the report.\n",
    "3. Write a conclusion summary.\n",
    "4. Suggest next steps and recommendations for research and/or model improvement.\n",
    "5. Run final report notebook from beginning to be sure that there are no errors.\n",
    "6. Submit link to repository containing project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Reproduce\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repository, ensuring the following files have successfully been cloned:\n",
    " - jobs.csv\n",
    " - Report.ipynb\n",
    " - wrangle.py\n",
    " - wrangle.ipynb\n",
    " - explore.ipynb\n",
    " - model.ipynb\n",
    "2. If not already installed on your system, install pycountry-convert and wordcloud:\n",
    " - `pip install pycountry-convert`\n",
    " - `pip install wordcloud`\n",
    "3. Run all cells in Report.ipynb.\n",
    "4. If desired, run all cells in the other Jupyter notebooks (wrangle.ipynb, explore.ipynb, model.ipynb) in this repository to see my full, in-depth step-by-step process for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "Always stay vigilant when giving personal information to potential employers. Fake job listings are becoming both more common and more sophisticated. Some red flags to keep an eye out for include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Given more time and resources, I would like to find more job listings that do specify a salary range. The majority of entries in this dataset did not have a salary range but I think it would be interesting to see what, if any, correlation there is between stated salary ranges and authenticity of job postings."
